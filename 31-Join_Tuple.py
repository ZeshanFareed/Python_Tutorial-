# Join Two Tuples
# To join two or more tuples you can use the + operator:

tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)


print()
# If you want to multiply the content of a tuple a given number of times,
# you can use the * operator:

fruits = ("grapes","apple","banana",2)
thistuple = fruits * 2
print(thistuple)
