# You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.
# But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

# Check if "banana" is present in the set:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print("banana" in thisset)


print()
# Check if "banana" is NOT present in the set:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print("banana" not in thisset)
